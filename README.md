Gregory Mazurek's Blog
====

This is my blog.

It's on github-pages and Jekyll.

The style was based, initially, on Flex: https://www.jekyllthemes.net/store/blog/flex/

But since then, it's been modified heavily.

The content and images are all "all rights reserved" to Gregory Mazurek.

The blog is open so you can see how to create a functioning github-pages blog.
