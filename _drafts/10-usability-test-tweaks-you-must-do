##10. Test Your Competition

It's pretty obvious that you need to usability test whatever feature you've just created. But, you're likely to learn a lot if you usability test a similar feature that your competition has in the wild. When you do this, you can begin to understand how your users use your competitor's product.

##9. Offsite Testing

Inviting users to your office to usability test a feature is convenient and easy. But, this environment isn't exactly going to be where your user is going to use your product. Go to them. Go visit your users where they will be using your product and conduct the usability test there. You'll find interesting insights like color contrast under the bright sun, for example.

##8. Leave The User Alone With The Product

Offer a fake reason to go get water, coffee, or something to snack on. But while doing so, leave the product with the user and tell her she can play with it. She may feel more comfortable playing around with it while you aren't there and without specific instructions to play with it.
