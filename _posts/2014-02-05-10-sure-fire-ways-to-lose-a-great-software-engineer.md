There's always a lot of chatter about how to hire well but less chatter about how to retain well. Hiring is tough but once you find someone amazing, you now have to worry about keeping the engineer happy. It's not that hard but often overlooked, especially as companies grow and change in different directions. Here, I present to you 10 surefire ways to lose your great engineer.

##1. Interrupt the engineer, constantly.

A neat way to get your engineer to update his LinkedIn resume quickly is to constantly interrupt him. Engineers need continuous periods to concentrate. If you're constantly tapping on his shoulder, you're basically pushing him out the door.

##2. Make engineering a second-class business priority.

Sweet, now your engineer has just left for a company where tech is one of the business' priorities.

##3. Surround your engineer with colleagues of a much, much lower calibre.

Great engineers want to be around other, great engineers. 

##4. Don't deploy to production frequently.

Have a great idea for a website feature that's going to take nine months before it gets to production? Cool! Can you divide that into nine separate projects that can be released once a month before your engineer starts taking an interview a month?

##5. Create tools that slow the engineering cycle to a halt.

How much time does it take your engineer to deploy a small fix to production? If you answered in hours or days, your engineer is using those same hours and days wondering who is hiring where he can deploy in minutes.

##6. Initiate a culture of "no".

Won't let the engineer use a popular open-source technology because you've created a proprietary version? Won't let the engineer experiment with a new language? Won't listen to the engineer's technical ideas? Will you listen to him during the exit interview?

##7. Hold lots of meetings.

When the engineer thinks back to what he accomplished last month, he doesn't want to be thinking about the number of times he heard "thought leader", "blue sky thinking", and "blocked." He wants to remember all the code he pushed to production.

##8. Make him work late nights and weekends.

If he wants to, great! If he doesn't, don't make him. You'll pay the price with a bunch of bugs caused by fatigue and an open requisite for an engineer who left for a company where he doesn't have to work on Sundays.

##9. Disempower him.

You call the shots. Always. Don't let him do anything not explicitly told to him. Don't even let him smile when he leaves the building for the last time.

##10. Know everything.

You don't even have to say anything to make it known. If you have all the answers, you should know whether your amazing engineers are going to stick around.

What strategies do you know that guarantee you'll lose a great engineer (or employee)?
