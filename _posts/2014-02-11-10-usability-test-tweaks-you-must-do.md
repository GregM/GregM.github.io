##10. Test Your Competition

It's pretty obvious that you need to usability test whatever feature you've just created. But, you're likely to learn a lot if you usability test a similar feature that your competition has in the wild. When you do this, you can begin to understand how your users use your competitor's product.

##9. Offsite Testing

Inviting users to your office to usability test a feature is convenient and easy. But, this environment isn't exactly going to be where your user is going to use your product. Go to them. Go visit your users where they will be using your product and conduct the usability test there. You'll find interesting insights you wouldn't find otherwise... like color contrast under the bright sun, for example.

##8. Leave The User Alone With The Product

Offer a fake reason to go get water, coffee, or something to snack on. But while doing so, leave the product with the user and tell her she can play with it. She may feel more comfortable playing around with it while you aren't there and without specific instructions as to what to do.

##7. Test Early In The Development Cycle

Don't wait until the product is finished to begin usability testing. Are you really going to throw the product away if the usability testing goes awry at this point? OK, maybe you learn something dreadful and you have to abandon the product. Learn early. Learn as your working on the product, not after you've finished it.

##6. Compensate Your User With Your Product

Are you paying cash to your users or giving them a gift certificate for use at a later time to usability test your product? It's not an awful strategy but you can do a lot better. If you're a t-shirt company, give them a choice of an upcoming t-shirt... and observe which one they pick and why. If you're an ecommerce company, give them $25 to spend on the website... in front of you during and as the usability test.

##5. The First Five Minutes

How long do your usability tests usually last? Thirty minutes? An hour? How long do your users usually interact with your product in the wild? If it's not thirty minutes or an hour, you might not be getting the information you want. If your average user spends five minutes with your product, usability test your user by asking her to use your product for five minutes. Does she get bored? When? At what point? What was she doing?

##4. Turn The Table And Have Your Users Usability Test You

How will your users talk about your product with their friends and colleagues? Find out by asking them to sell you on the product. Don't give them any hints or instructions. What do use as selling points? What do they ommit? How do they showcase the product to you? What features are most important?

##3. Multiple Users At Once

If people are around other people, they'll talk to one another. Bring three users into a usability test and let them talk about the product with each other. It's not a focus group because they'll each use the product. Instead, you'll get information that they share with each other that they may not have thought to share with you, the creator.

##2. Test Older Versions Of Your Product

Make sure to validate your previous decisions by having your users test previous versions of your product. Were your decision and user-experience decisions correct? Is the newer feature actually an upgrade or improvement? Or, is the difference only marginably different to your user.

##1. Bring Them Back

Were they great during the usability session? Did some of their comments surprise you? Did you implement those decisions and now, they're successes in the wild? If yes, bring them back for more. Don't shy away from being close your best users.
