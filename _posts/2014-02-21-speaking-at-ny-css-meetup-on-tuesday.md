I'll be speaking at the NY CSS Meetup on Tuesday, February 25 at 6:30PM and there are still a few spots open [here](http://www.meetup.com/nyccssux/events/156810572/).

If you attend, you'll hear more about how I design for the mobile web from both a [Card UI](https://www.google.com/search?q=card+ui&tbm=isch) and [Web Components](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) perspective. The entire approach is wrapped in how you might think about mobile web design as design the interior for yuor NYC apartment.

I hope you attend and if you do, please make sure to connect with me at the event. I'll post slides afterwards.
